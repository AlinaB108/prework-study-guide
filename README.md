# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is a prework study guide for bootcamp students. I built this project to help students to add and track the notes taken throughout bootcamp. The prework study guide helps to organize the notes and not be overwhelmed by the big amount of new information.

## Usage

There are 4 sections in this guide: HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. Each section contains few notes from prework. When we open DevTools console in our browser Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows), we can see a list of 4 topics. We also have running JavaScript in the background which chooses one of the topics for us to study first. The choice option is randomized.
